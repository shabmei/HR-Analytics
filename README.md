## Problem Statement
The complex issue of attrition in a corporate environment presents a significant challenge for the HR Department. HR Analytics assumes a crucial role by interpreting organizational data, identifying pertinent people-related trends, and empowering proactive measures essential for sustaining the organization's operational efficiency and profitability.

## Hypothesis
1. Single employees may demonstrate a higher likelihood of attrition compared to married or committed counterparts.
2. Employees with shorter tenures at the company might display a higher probability of attrition compared to those with longer tenures.
3. Employees frequently engaged in business travel might exhibit higher attrition rates due to potential work-life balance challenges or dissatisfaction arising from extensive travel commitments.
4. Employees with lower education levels might demonstrate a higher inclination for attrition compared to those with higher educational qualifications.
5. Variations in attrition rates based on gender may exist within the organization.

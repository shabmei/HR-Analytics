## Problem Statement
The complex issue of attrition in a corporate environment presents a significant challenge for the HR Department. HR Analytics assumes a crucial role by interpreting company data, identifying pertinent people-related trends, and empowering proactive measures essential for sustaining the company's operational efficiency and profitability.

## Hypothesis
1. Single employees may demonstrate a higher likelihood of attrition compared to married counterparts.
2. Employees with shorter tenures at the company might display a higher probability of attrition compared to those with longer tenures.
3. Employees frequently engaged in business travel might exhibit higher attrition rates due to potential work-life balance challenges or dissatisfaction arising from extensive travel commitments.
4. Employees with lower education levels might demonstrate a higher inclination for attrition compared to those with higher educational qualifications.
5. Variations in attrition rates based on gender may exist within the company.

## Summary of Findings
- Out of the total 1470 employees, there was an attrition rate of 16.12%, equating to 237 employees who left the company.
- The Research & Development department has the highest attrition rate for 56.12% (133 employees) of the total number of employees.
- Life Sciences recorded the most attritions among educational fields, with 89 employees.
- The most significant attrition occurred among male employees aged between 25 to 34 years.
- Employees who rarely traveled experienced the most substantial attrition, amounting to 65.82% (156 people) of the total employees.
- Single male employees experienced the highest number of attritions.
- Employees with shorter tenures at the company displayed a higher attrition rate compared to those with longer tenures.
- The Laboratory Technician job role has the highest number of employee attrition compared to other roles.

## Suggestions
- Conduct surveys or interviews to understand the specific issues leading to attrition within the Research & Development department. For instance, identify if it's related to workload, leadership, growth opportunities, or other factors causing dissatisfaction.
- Develop strategies specifically for Laboratory Technicians such as career development paths, skills training, or mentorship programs tailored to address the unique needs and career aspirations of Laboratory Technicians.
- For reduced attrition among employees aged 25-34 or singles, companies could provide options like flexible work, career development programs, and initiatives promoting work-life balance.
- Provide comprehensive onboarding, mentorship, and regular feedback mechanisms for new employees to acclimate well and feel valued within the company, reducing early attrition.
